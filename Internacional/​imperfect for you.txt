My boy, come take my hand
Throw your guitar and your clothes in the back seat
My love, they don't understand
But I'll hold your hurt in the box here beside me

How could we know
We'd rearrange all the cosmos? Mmm
We crashed and we burned
Now I just can't go where you don't go

And usually I'm

Fucked up, anxious, too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy, completely distressed
But I'm not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Let's go tonight
'Causе there's just a few sеconds left till tomorrow
We have all that we need
Let's leave our baggage and wine at the table (mmm)

Mmm, how could we know
That this was a happy disaster? Mmm (happy disaster, mmm)
I'm glad we crashed and burned (we crashed and burned)
I'll never forget when you told me

You said: Usually I'm

Fucked up (fucked up), anxious (anxious), too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy (messy), completely distressed (distressed)
But I'm not like that since I met you

Mmm, how could we know
We'd make the bad stuff delightful? Mmm
I'm glad we crashed and burned
I know we'll be there for each other

When we're feeling

Fucked up (fucked up), anxious (anxious), too much
But I'll love you like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy (messy), completely distressed (distressed)
But I'm not like that since I met you
Imperfect for you

Fucked up (fucked up), anxious (anxious), too much
Like you need me to
Imperfect for you
Messy (messy), completely distressed (distressed)
Like that since I met you
Imperfect for you
